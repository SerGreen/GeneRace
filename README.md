## About
* Cars have a set of sensors (surface type detectors, speedometer, etc.)
* Cars have a set of rules like "IF &lt;SENSOR_CONDITION&gt; THEN DO &lt;ACTION&gt;".
* Riding on road is faster than on grass.
* The goal is to cross every checkpoint in order.
* Reaching checkpoint counts towards fitness function. The faster a car reaches a checkpoint, the more points it receives.
* At the end of each turn best cars are selected, their sets of rules are converted into 'chromosomes'. New population is created using crossover and mutations of selected 'chromosomes'.
